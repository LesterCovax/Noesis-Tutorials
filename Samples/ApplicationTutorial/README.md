This is the sample corresponding to the [Application Framework](http://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.ApplicationTutorial.html) tutorial.

This framework is an open source library that provides abstractions to create multiplatform applications. The framework is a good example about how to use Noesis and it provides many helpers that can be useful. All our samples use the application framework.

The extensions provided, like *Application* and *Window*, are compatible with WPF, so compatible with *Microsoft Blend*. Using the application framework you can design applications that will indistinctly run in a Windows window, macOS window, iPhone screen, or Xbox TV for example. The framework supports all the platforms where NoesisGUI is available.
